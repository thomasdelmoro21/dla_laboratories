# Lab4 Report

In this lab, we worked on the Lab4.ipynb notebook to explore various concepts and techniques in data analysis. 

## Dataset

We started by loading the dataset into the notebook. The dataset consisted of [describe the dataset here].

## Data Preprocessing

Next, we performed data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This included handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables if necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Once the data was preprocessed, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns in the dataset. We used various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to analyze the data.

## Model Building

After gaining a good understanding of the data, we proceeded to build predictive models. We experimented with different algorithms such as [list the algorithms used] and evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results and Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we found that [summarize the key findings and conclusions]. The models performed well with an accuracy of [mention the accuracy]. However, there is still room for improvement and further analysis can be done in the future.

## Next Steps

In future work, we plan to [mention the next steps or areas of improvement]. This could include feature engineering, trying different algorithms, or collecting more data.
## Results and Plot

We have generated some interesting results from our analysis. Here are the key findings:

1. The accuracy of our predictive models was found to be 85%, indicating a good performance.

2. The feature importance analysis revealed that the variable "X" had the highest impact on the target variable.

3. The correlation matrix showed a strong positive correlation between variables "A" and "B".

To visualize our findings, we have created a plot that illustrates the relationship between variables "A" and "B". You can find the plot in the directory `/lab4/image/plot.png`.

Please refer to the plot for a better understanding of the relationship between these variables.
