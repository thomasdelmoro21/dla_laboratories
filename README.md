# Deep Learning Applications - Laboratories
This repository contains all the laboratories completed for the Deep Learning Applications course. Each laboratory includes the code and its corresponding documentation in the README files. The projects aim to understand and apply new technologies in various areas of Deep Learning.

## Lab. 1 - CNNs
The first laboratory focuses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), exploring their application in image recognition and processing using deep learning techniques.

## Lab. 2 - LLMs
This directory contains a laboratory dedicated to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), aiming to understand their architecture and applications in Natural Language Processing.

## Lab. 4 - OOD and FGSM
This section features a laboratory on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection and Adversarial Learning, focusing on techniques like ODIN for the first and FGSM for the latter. Furthermore it includes a section about strategies for improving model robustness against adversarial attacks.
